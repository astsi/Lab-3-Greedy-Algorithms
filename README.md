 Algorithm design and analysis, Lab 3

Implement data compression algorithms that can be categorized as Greedy algorithms (Shannon-Fano and Huffman), and compare them by efficiency and execution time.
Two categories of files should be prepared for testing - with randomly generated characters, with meaningful text in Serbian and meaningful text in English.
In each category you need one file of 100, 1000, 10k, 100k and 1M characters. For the case of 100 characters, display the code table and the compression result on the standard output. Compression and decompression need to be done for all categories.
